# Modal-Analysis-of-SPT-4-Cryostat-Support-Structures
Modal analysis of 300 Kelvin to 4 Kelvin G10 supports and the 4 Kelvin to 100 milliKelvin Titanium focal plane supports

## My Role:
- Led design and validation efforts
- Defined design criteria with input from the Optics team (physical layout, materials, weight distribution, etc)
- Built finite element analysis pipeline to evaluate possible design choices

## Summary of Results:
- Hybrid G10 tab and bipod design limits thermal stress from differential thermal contraction and maintains good resonant frequency (~19 Hz)
- Titanium hexapod design has the highest resonant frequency of focal plane supports (~144 Hz)
